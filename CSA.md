# Cloud Service Agreement

## USING THIS AGREEMENT
This Agreement allows <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> to access and use the Cloud Service. To use this Agreement, the parties must complete and sign or electronically accept a Cover Page and Order Form.
Capitalized and highlighted words have the meanings given on the Cover Page or in the Order Form. However, if the Cover Page or Order Form omit or do not define a highlighted word, the default meaning will be “none” or “not applicable”. All other capitalized words have the meanings given in these Standard Terms.

1. ## Service  

    1.1 Access and Use.  During the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> and subject to the <span class="orderform_link">Use Limitations</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may access and use the Cloud Service for its internal business purposes. If the Cloud Service includes Software or Documentation, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may copy and use the Software and Documentation only as needed to access and use the Cloud Service and only if <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> complies with the terms of this Agreement.

    1.2 User Accounts.  <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is responsible for all actions on its Users' accounts and for its Users' compliance with this Agreement. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> and its Users must protect the confidentiality of its passwords and login credentials. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will promptly notify <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> if it suspects or knows of any fraudulent activity with its accounts, passwords, or credentials, or if they become compromised.

    1.3 Affiliates.  If Affiliates are authorized as Users in an Order Form, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> Affiliates may receive User accounts under <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> Agreement and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will be responsible for its Affiliates' compliance with this Agreement. If a <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Affiliate enters a separate Cover Page with <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>, the <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> Affiliate creates a separate agreement between <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> and that Affiliate, where <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> responsibility to the Affiliate is individual and separate from <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is not responsible for its Affiliates' agreement.

    1.4 Feedback and Usage Data.  <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may, but is not required to, give <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Feedback, in which case <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> gives Feedback “AS IS”. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may use all Feedback freely without any restriction or obligation. In addition, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may collect and analyze Usage Data, and <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may freely use Usage Data to maintain, improve, and enhance <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> products and services without restriction or obligation. However, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may only share Usage Data with others if the Usage Data does not identify <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span>.

    1.5 Customer Content.  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may copy, display, modify, and use <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content only as needed to provide and maintain the Cloud Service and related offerings. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is responsible for the accuracy and content of <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> represents and warrants that it has and will continue to have all rights necessary to submit or make available <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content to the Cloud Service and to allow <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> to use <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content as described in the Agreement.

2. ## Restrictions & Obligations  

    2.1 Restrictions On Customer.

      (a) Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will not (and will not allow any anyone else to): (i) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Cloud Service (except to the extent Applicable Laws prohibit this restriction); (ii) provide, sell, transfer, sublicense, lend, distribute, rent, or otherwise allow others to access or use the Cloud Service; (iii) remove any proprietary notices or labels; (iv) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Cloud Service; (v) conduct security or vulnerability tests on, interfere with the operation of, or circumvent access restrictions of the Cloud Service; (vi) access accounts, information, data, or portions of the Cloud Service to which <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> does not have explicit authorization; (vii) use the Cloud Service to develop a competing product; or (viii) use the Cloud Service with any High Risk Activities or with activity prohibited by Applicable Laws.

      (b) <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> use of the Cloud Service must comply with the <span class="coverpage_link">Acceptable Use Policy</span>, if any.

    2.2 Support.  During the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will provide <span class="orderform_link">Product Support</span> as described in the Order Form, if any.  

    2.3 Service Level.  If the Cloud Service does not meet the <span class="orderform_link">SLA</span>, if any, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will provide the remedies outlined in the <span class="orderform_link">SLA</span> and will not be responsible for any other remedies. If there is an <span class="orderform_link">SLA</span>, any credits earned under the <span class="orderform_link">SLA</span> will only apply to future invoices and expire if the Agreement ends. In any event, if the Cloud Service is temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance, for unscheduled emergency maintenance, or because of other causes beyond <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> reasonable control, no <span class="orderform_link">SLA</span> remedies will accrue. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will try to inform <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> before scheduled service disruptions through the Cloud Service or by email.

    2.4 Suspension.  If <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> (a) has an outstanding, undisputed balance on its account for more than 30 days after the <span class="orderform_link">Payment Period</span>, (b) breaches Section 2.1 (Restrictions on <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span>), or (c) uses the Cloud Service in violation of the Agreement and in a way that materially and negatively impacts the Cloud Service or others, then <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may temporarily suspend <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> access to the Cloud Service with or without notice. However, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will try to inform <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> before suspending <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> account when practical. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will reinstate <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> access to the Cloud Service only if <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> resolves the underlying issue.

3. ## Professional Services  

    <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will perform the <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span> as detailed in an Order Form, if any, and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will reasonably cooperate with <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> to allow the performance of <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span>, including providing <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content as needed. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> is not responsible for any inability to perform the <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span> if <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> does not cooperate as reasonably requested.

4. ## Privacy & Security  

    4.1 Personal Data.  Before submitting Personal Data governed by GDPR, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> must enter into a data processing agreement with <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>. If the parties have a <span class="coverpage_link">DPA</span>, the terms of the <span class="coverpage_link">DPA</span> will control each party's rights and obligations as to Personal Data and the terms of the <span class="coverpage_link">DPA</span> will control in the event of any conflict with these Standard Terms.  

    4.2 Prohibited Data.  <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will not (and will not allow anyone else to) submit Sensitive Data to the Cloud Service unless authorized by the Cover Page. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> and Users may only submit Sensitive Data to the Cloud Service in accordance with the Cover Page and Documentation.  

    4.3 Security.  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will comply with the <span class="coverpage_link">Security Policy</span>, if any.

5. ## Payment & Taxes  

    5.1 Fees & Invoices.  Unless otherwise agreed in an Order Form, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are exclusive of taxes. Except for the prorated refund of prepaid fees allowed with specific termination rights, fees are non-refundable. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will send invoices for applicable fees once per <span class="orderform_link">Invoice Period</span> starting on the <span class="coverpage_link">Effective Date</span>. Invoices for <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span> may be sent monthly during performance of the <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span> unless the Order Form includes a different cadence.

    5.2 Payment.  <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will pay <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> the fees and taxes in each invoice within the <span class="orderform_link">Payment Period</span> following receipt of the invoice.

    5.3 Taxes.  <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is responsible for all duties, taxes, and levies that apply to fees or an Order Form, including sales, use, VAT, GST, or withholding, that <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> itemizes and includes in an invoice. However, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is not responsible for <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> income taxes.

    5.4 Payment Dispute.  If <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> has a good-faith disagreement about the amounts charged on an invoice, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> must notify <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> about the dispute during the <span class="orderform_link">Payment Period</span> for the invoice and must pay all undisputed amounts on time. The parties will work together to resolve the dispute within 15 days after the end of the <span class="orderform_link">Payment Period</span>. If no resolution is agreed, each party may pursue any remedies available under the Agreement or Applicable Laws.

Each Order Form will start on the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Start Date</span>, continue for the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>, and automatically renew for additional <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Periods</span> unless one party gives written notice of non-renewal to the other party before the <span class="coverpage_link">Renewal Notice Date</span> of the then-current <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>.

A party must notify the other of its reason for termination.

    6.4 Effect of Termination.  Termination of the Agreement will automatically terminate all Order Forms. Upon expiration or termination:  

      (a) <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will no longer have any right to use the Cloud Service, <span class="orderform_link">Product Support</span>, or <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span>.

      (b) Upon <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> request, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will delete <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content within 60 days of termination.

      (c) Each Recipient will return or destroy Discloser's Confidential Information in its possession or control.

7. ## Representations & Warranties  

    7.1 Mutual.  Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, (b) it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction of its origin, (c) it will comply with all Applicable Laws in performing its obligations or exercising its rights in this Agreement, and (d) it will comply with the <span class="coverpage_link">Additional Warranties</span>.

    7.2 From <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>.  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> represents and warrants to <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> that (a) it will not materially reduce the general functionality of the Cloud Service during a <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>; and (b) it will perform <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span> in a competent and professional manner.

    7.3 <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Warranty Remedy.  If <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> breaches the warranty in Section 7.2, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> must give <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> written notice (with enough detail for <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> to understand or replicate the issue) within 45 days of discovering the issue. Within 45 days of receiving sufficient details of the warranty issue, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will attempt to restore the general functionality of the Cloud Service or reperform the <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span>. If <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> cannot resolve the issue, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may terminate the affected Order Form and <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will pay to <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> restoration and reperformance obligations, and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> termination right, are <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> only remedies if <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> does not meet the warranty in Section 7.2.

8. ## Disclaimer of Warranties  
<span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> makes no guarantees that the Cloud Service will always be safe, secure, or error-free, or that it will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. The warranties in Section 7.2 do not apply to any misuse or unauthorized modification of the Cloud Service, nor to any product or service provided by anyone other than <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> each disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. These disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

9. ## Limitation of Liability  

    9.1 Liability Caps.  If there are <span class="coverpage_link">Increased Claims</span>, each party's total cumulative liability for the <span class="coverpage_link">Increased Claims</span> arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not be more than the <span class="coverpage_link">Increased Cap Amount</span>. Each party's total cumulative liability for all other claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not be more than the <span class="coverpage_link">General Cap Amount</span>.

    9.2 Damages Waiver.  Each party's liability for any claim or liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. Under no circumstances will either party be liable to the other for lost profits or revenues, or for consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages relating to this Agreement, even if the party is informed of the possibility of this type of damage in advance.

    9.3 Exceptions.  If there are <span class="coverpage_link">Unlimited Claims</span>, the liability caps in Section 9.1 and the damages waiver in Section 9.2 do not apply to the <span class="coverpage_link">Unlimited Claims</span>. If there are <span class="coverpage_link">Increased Claims</span>, the damages waiver in Section 9.2 does not apply to the <span class="coverpage_link">Increased Claims</span>.

10. ## Indemnification  

    10.1 Protection by <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>.  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will defend and hold harmless <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> from and against all <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Covered Claims made by someone other than <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> Affiliates, or Users, and indemnify <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> for all out-of-pocket damages, awards, settlements, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal expenses, that directly result from the <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Covered Claim.

    10.2 Protection by <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span>.  <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> will defend and hold harmless <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> from and against all <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Covered Claims made by someone other than <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> or its Affiliates, and indemnify <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> for all out-of-pocket damages, awards, settlements, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal expenses, that directly result from the <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Covered Claim.

    10.3 Procedure.  The Indemnifying Party's obligations in this section are contingent upon the Protected Party: (a) promptly notifying the Indemnifying Party of each Covered Claim for which it seeks protection; (b) providing reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party's expense; and (c) giving the Indemnifying Party sole control over the defense and settlement of each Covered Claim. A Protected Party may participate in a Covered Claim for which it seeks protection with its own attorneys only at its own expense. An Indemnifying Party may not agree to any settlement of a Covered Claim that contains an admission of fault or otherwise materially and adversely impacts the Protected Party without the prior written consent of the Protected Party.

    10.4 Changes to Cloud Service.  If required by settlement or court order, or if deemed reasonably necessary in response to a <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Covered Claim, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may: (a) obtain the right for <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> to continue using the Cloud Service; (b) replace or modify the affected component of the Cloud Service without materially reducing the general functionality of the Cloud Service; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) are reasonable, terminate the affected Order Form and issue a pro-rated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>.

    10.5 Exclusions.  

      (a) <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> obligations as an Indemnifying Party will not apply to <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Covered Claims that result from (i) modifications to the Cloud Service that were not authorized by <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> or that were made in compliance with <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> instructions, (ii) unauthorized use of the Cloud Service, including use in violation of this Agreement, (iii) use of the Cloud Service in combination with items not provided by <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>, or (iv) use of an old version of the Cloud Service where a newer release would avoid the <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> Covered Claim.

      (b) <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> obligations as an Indemnifying Party will not apply to <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Covered Claims that result from the unauthorized use of the <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content, including use in violation of this Agreement.

    10.6 Exclusive Remedy.  This Section 10 (Indemnification), together with any termination rights, describes each Protected Party's exclusive remedy and each Indemnifying Party's entire liability for a Covered Claim.

11. ## Insurance  
During the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> and for six months after, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will carry commercial insurance policies with coverage limits of at least the <span class="coverpage_link">Insurance Minimums</span>, if any. Upon request, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will give <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> a certificate of insurance evidencing its insurance policies that meet the <span class="coverpage_link">Insurance Minimums</span>. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> insurance policies will not be considered as evidence of <span class="coverpage_link">Provider's</span> liability.

12. ## Confidentiality  

    12.1 Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.  Unless otherwise authorized in the Agreement, Recipient will (a) only use Discloser's Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement, and (b) not disclose Discloser's Confidential Information to anyone else. In addition, Recipient will protect Discloser's Confidential Information using at least the same protections Recipient uses for its own similar information but no less than a reasonable standard of care.

    12.2 Exclusions.  Confidential Information does not include information that (a) Recipient knew without any obligation of confidentiality before disclosure by Discloser, (b) is or becomes publicly known and generally available through no fault of Recipient, (c) Recipient receives under no obligation of confidentiality from someone else who is authorized to make the disclosure, or (d) Recipient independently developed without use of or reference to Discloser's Confidential Information.

    12.3 Required Disclosures.  Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential Information to the extent required by Applicable Laws if, unless prohibited by Applicable Laws, Recipient provides the Disclosing Party reasonable advance notice of the required disclosure and reasonably cooperates, at the Discloser's expense, with the Discloser's efforts to obtain confidential treatment for the Confidential Information.

    12.4 Permitted Disclosures.  Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential Information to Users, employees, advisors, contractors, and representatives who each have a need to know the Confidential Information, but only if the individual is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Section 12 and Recipient remains responsible for everyone's compliance with the terms of this Section 12.

13. ## Reservation of Rights  

    Except for the limited license to copy and use Software and Documentation in Section 1.1 (Access and Use), <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Cloud Service. All Software and Documentation available to <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span>, including as part of <span class="orderform_link">Product Support</span> or <span class="orderform_link">Professional Services</span>, are part of the Cloud Services, whether developed before or after the <span class="coverpage_link">Effective Date</span>. Except for the limited rights in Section 1.5 (<span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content), <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> retains all right, title, and interest in and to the <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> Content.

14. ## General Terms  

    14.1 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in writing or not) about its subject. <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> expressly rejects any terms included in <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> purchase order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or administrative purposes.

    14.2 Modifications, Severability, and Waiver.  Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party. However, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may update <span class="orderform_link">Product Support</span>, the <span class="orderform_link">SLA</span>, the <span class="coverpage_link">Security Policy</span>, or the <span class="coverpage_link">Acceptable Use Policy</span> by giving <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> 30 days prior notice. During the 30-day notice period, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may terminate the Agreement or affected Order Form if the update is a material reduction from the prior version. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or right.

    14.3 <span class="coverpage_link">Governing Law</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Chosen Courts</span>.  The <span class="coverpage_link">Governing Law</span> will govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties will bring any legal suit, action, or proceeding about this Agreement in the <span class="coverpage_link">Chosen Courts</span> and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the <span class="coverpage_link">Chosen Courts</span>.

    14.4 Injunctive Relief.  Despite Section 14.3 (<span class="coverpage_link">Governing Law</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Chosen Courts</span>), a breach of Section 12 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party's intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 12 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party's intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.

    14.5 Non-Exhaustive Remedies.  Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.

    14.6 Assignment.  Neither party may sell or assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may assign this Agreement upon notice if the assigning party undergoes a merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

    14.7 No Publicity.  Neither party may publicly announce the existence of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

    14.8 Notices.  Any notice, request, or approval about the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the <span class="coverpage_link">Notice Address</span>. Notices will be deemed given (a) upon confirmed delivery if by email, registered or certified mail, or personal delivery; or (b) two days after mailing if by overnight commercial delivery.

    14.9 Independent Contractors.  The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners, or joint venturers. Neither party is authorized to bind the other to any liability or obligation.

    14.10 No Third-Party Beneficiary.  There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

    14.11 Force Majeure.  Neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations of this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event. However, this section does not excuse <span class="coverpage_link">Customer's</span> obligations to pay fees.

    14.12 Export Controls. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Cloud Service, Software, or any related technology or materials in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority.  

    14.13 Government Rights.  The Cloud Service and Software are deemed “commercial items” or “commercial computer software” according to FAR section 12.212 and DFAR section 227.7202, and the Documentation is “commercial computer software documentation” according to DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5).
